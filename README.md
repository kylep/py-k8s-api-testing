# Python Kubernetes API testing

This repository is being used while I learn how to operate Kubernetes through the API server from
Python's requests library.

I'll also try out the kubernetes python library, though my experience with OpenStack's python
library has given me a preference for going straight to the APIs.

```
virtualenv --python=python3 env/
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
